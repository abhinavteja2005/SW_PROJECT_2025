# FASTx

FASTx is a **Flask-based full-stack web application**, inspired by Blinkit, designed to simulate a hyperlocal grocery delivery service with integrated support for customers, store managers, delivery agents, and administrators. The system enables browsing, ordering, managing inventory, and optimizing deliveries in real time.

---

## Objective

To create a modular, scalable, and testable delivery system that supports:

### Customer Interface

- Browse items from multiple stores with detailed product information.
- Search by item name and category.
- Real-time stock availability indicators.
- Shopping cart management (add/remove functionality).
- Multiple payment options: **Card, UPI, COD**.
- View order history and track orders in real-time.
- I added a "Complete Vide Guide to the webapp", please check it as well, it can be seen in the repo.

### Delivery System

- Track real-time order status: *collected, in transit, delivered*.
- Maintain delivery history for all agents.
- Assign delivery tasks based on location and availability.
- Pre-computed distance matrices for fast route optimization.
- Dynamic shortest-path route planning considering:
  - Delivery agent's current location
  - Store locations
  - Customer addresses
  - Order status

### Store Management

- Dedicated dashboards for each store manager (3 stores total).
- Inventory management: add, edit, remove items.
- Monitor and update stock levels.
- Manage prices and discounts.
- Handle and track order fulfillment.
- View store-specific analytics and order history.

### Admin Dashboard

- Oversee all users, stores, and orders.
- Monitor delivery agents and their assignments.
- View system-wide statistics and performance analytics.

### Authentication & Security

- Secure login system for all roles (customer, delivery, store, admin).
- **Role-based access control**.
- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt**.
- Session management for seamless navigation and persistent login.

## Testing

* All modules include **unit and integration tests** under the `tests/` directory.
* Uses **pytest** for testing.
* Code coverage is tracked via `coverage.py` and exported to `coverage.xml`.

### To run tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration.

### `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`

The workflow performs:

* Code checkout
* Python environment setup
* Dependency installation
* Running unit tests with `pytest`
* Checking code coverage

This ensures all pushes and pull requests are automatically validated.
